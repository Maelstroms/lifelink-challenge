Step 1: Get the Materials

Get the Materials
To make the perfect PB&J sandwich you will need:

-A clean, flat food production surface (I use a clean cutting board)
-Peanut butter of your choice
-Jelly, jam, or preserves of your choice
-2 slices of sandwich bread
-A clean butter knife

Step 2: Prepare the Bread

Prepare the Bread

Position the bread slices on the clean surface side-by-side, with one slice face up and the other face down.

This step is vital because it will allow the slices of bread to evenly match together when combining them in Step 5.

Step 3: Apply Peanut Butter

Apply Peanut Butter

Using the knife, scoop a large dollop of peanut butter and spread it onto the top of each slice of bread.  Use as much peanut butter as desired.

Putting peanut butter on each side will prevent the bread from getting soggy from the jelly- this is especially important if preparing the sandwich ahead of time.

Step 4: Apply Jelly

Apply Jelly

Using the same technique as with the peanut butter, scoop out the desired amount of jelly. Spread it on top of the peanut butter of one slice of bread.

Putting jelly on both sides will only lead to a mess, with jelly spewing out the sides of the sandwich.

Step 5: Combine Both Slices of Bread

Combine Both Slices of Bread


Take the slice of bread without jelly on it and flip it on top of the jelly of the other slice.  You should now have a layered PB&J sandwich with peanut butter on the top and bottom and jelly in the center.

Step 6: Eat and Repeat

Eat and Repeat

That's it!  Now you can satisfy your hunger with a delicious, non-soggy peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Repeat as necessary until you are full or run out of peanut butter. Enjoy!
